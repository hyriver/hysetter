## Features

HySetter is an open-source Python package, built on HyRiver software stack, that
provides a command-line interface (CLI) and Python API for subsetting hydroclimate data
from the following data sources over the conterminous United States (CONUS):

- **Area Of Interest**: From any
    [HUC](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/watershed-boundary-dataset) level,
    [GAGES-II basins](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/70046617),
    [NHDPlusV2](https://www.nhdplus.com/NHDPlus/NHDPlusV2_home.php) catchments and their
    attributes
    ([StreamCat](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat-dataset)
    and [NLDI](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/docs/nldi/about-nldi/index.html)), or a
    user-defined GeoDataFrame
- **Drainage Network**: From NHDPlusV2
- **Forcing**: From [Daymet](https://daymet.ornl.gov/),
    [GridMET](https://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html), or
    [NLDAS2](https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/nldas/v2/forcing)
- **Streamflow**: From [NWIS](https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis)
- **Soil**: From
    [gNATSGO](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/gnatsgo-rasters), or
    [SoilGrids](https://www.isric.org/explore/soilgrids)
- **Topography**: From [3DEP](https://www.usgs.gov/3d-elevation-program)
- **Dam**: From [NID](https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil)
- **Land Use/Land Cover, Canopy, Imperviousness, and Urban Descriptor**: From
    [MRLC](https://www.mrlc.gov/)

Try HySetter in your browser by clicking on the Binder badge above. You can refer to the
[documentation](https://hysetter.readthedocs.io/latest/examples/) for more examples and
details.

## Installation

You can install `hysetter` using `pip`:

```console
pip install hysetter
```

Alternatively, `hysetter` can be installed from the `conda-forge` repository using
[micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html/):

```console
micromamba install -c conda-forge hysetter
```

You can use `conda` or `mamba` instead of `micromamba` if you prefer, but `micromamba`
is recommended for its efficiency and ease of use.

For just installing HySetter's CLI, you can first install Pixi by following the its
[installation instructions](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/) for your platform.
Then, you can install HySetter using the following command:

```console
pixi global install hysetter
```

## Quick start

Once HySetter is installed, you can use its CLI or Python API to subset hydroclimate
data via a configuration file. The configuration file is a YAML file that specifies the
data source, the area of interest (AOI), and the output directory. You can find an
example configuration file in the
[config_demo.yml](https://github.com/hyriver/hysetter/blob/main/config_demo.yml).
