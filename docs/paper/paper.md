# Summary

Hydrological modeling requires integrating diverse hydroclimate datasets, which often
creates a significant technical burden for researchers. HySetter addresses this
challenge by providing a command-line interface for automated subsetting of hydroclimate
data across the conterminous United States (CONUS). Built upon the HyRiver software
stack, HySetter streamlines data acquisition through a unified configuration file that
eliminates writing complex scripts for different data sources. By centralizing the
workflow, HySetter enables researchers to focus on scientific questions rather than data
preparation, while enhancing the reproducibility of hydrological research.

# Statement of Need

Hydrological research demands integration of diverse datasets spanning multiple scales.
The acquisition and processing of these datasets presents several challenges: (1)
Traditional approaches require complex scripts for different data sources, leading to
fragmented workflows; (2) Researchers often spend more time on data collection than
scientific analysis; (3) Technical overhead impacts novice researchers with limited
programming skills; (4) Experienced researchers develop redundant code for data
acquisition across projects.

These challenges undermine the adoption of FAIR principles [@wilkinson2016fair] in
hydrological research. While tools like HydroMT [@eilander2023hydromt] address similar
challenges for model building, a comparable solution for hydroclimate data acquisition
for CONUS is lacking.

HySetter fills this gap by providing a user-friendly framework requiring minimal
technical expertise while supporting advanced applications. Through a YAML configuration
file and command-line interface, HySetter democratizes access to hydroclimate data for
researchers of varying technical backgrounds.

# Functionality

HySetter employs a streamlined workflow in four steps: (1) The user defines the area of
interest in a YAML configuration file using HUCs, GAGES-II basins, NHDPlusV2 catchments,
or user-defined geometries; (2) The user specifies desired datasets and parameters in
the same file; (3) HySetter processes this configuration to access data through HyRiver;
(4) Data is standardized and saved in analysis-ready formats.

This approach accommodates different technical backgrounds: novice users can create
simple configuration files without coding, while experienced users can programmatically
generate configurations for complex analyses.

Figure \ref{fig:config-example} shows a typical configuration file, and
Figure \ref{fig:config-demo} demonstrates HySetter's command-line interface with progress
indicators.

HySetter currently supports subsetting from the following data sources:

- **Area of Interest**: HUC watersheds, GAGES-II basins, NHDPlusV2 catchments and their
    attributes (StreamCat and NLDI), or user-defined geometries
- **Drainage Network**: NHDPlusV2
- **Climate Forcing**: Daymet, GridMET, NLDAS2
- **Streamflow**: National Water Information System (NWIS)
- **Soil**: gNATSGO, SoilGrids
- **Topography**: 3D Elevation Program (3DEP)
- **Dams**: National Inventory of Dams (NID)
- **Land Use/Land Cover**: Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) products
    including land cover, canopy, imperviousness, and urban descriptors

# Implementation

HySetter's workflow is illustrated in \autoref{fig:flowchart}, showing data flow from
various sources through HyRiver to create subsets for specific areas. HySetter builds
upon the HyRiver stack [@chegini2021hyriver], which provides access to numerous
hydroclimate web services. While HyRiver requires Python programming knowledge, HySetter
adds an abstraction layer that translates user-friendly configuration files into
appropriate function calls.

The implementation follows modular design with three components: (1) **Configuration
Parser** processes YAML files to extract user requirements; (2) **Data Acquisition
Engine** interfaces with HyRiver to retrieve data; (3) **Output Manager** standardizes
and exports processed data for analysis.

HySetter provides detailed feedback through progress bars and messages during data
acquisition, helping users track operations and diagnose issues. The software includes
extensive error handling to manage challenges in accessing remote services.

Advanced users can utilize HySetter as a Python library with a user-friendly API for
further post-processing operations and integration with other libraries.

# Research Applications

HySetter has demonstrated utility in: (1) **Hydrological Modeling**: Implementation and
calibration of models across watersheds, leveraging consistent input datasets for
parameterization; (2) **Large-Scale Studies**: Analysis of regional patterns requiring
consistent data inputs across numerous basins; (3) **Educational Contexts**: Supporting
classroom exercises where students focus on hydrological processes rather than data
acquisition techniques.

The standardized, reproducible nature of HySetter workflows ensures research outputs can
be easily validated and extended, promoting transparency and collaboration. By
abstracting data retrieval complexities, HySetter enables researchers to focus on
answering critical hydrological questions rather than data preparation.

# Comparison with Existing Tools

Tools like HydroMT [@eilander2023hydromt] provide frameworks for model building and
analysis, while SWAT+AW [@chawanda2020user] offers automated workflows for the SWAT
model. However, these tools primarily target model building rather than standardized
data acquisition.

HySetter differentiates itself by focusing specifically on the data acquisition stage,
offering a streamlined solution for accessing hydroclimate data across CONUS. HySetter
is tailored to datasets commonly used in hydrological studies over CONUS, providing
optimized workflows. Its YAML-based configuration approach requires minimal technical
expertise, making it accessible to users with limited programming experience.

# Conclusions and Future Work

HySetter addresses a critical gap in hydrological modeling by providing a reproducible
framework for hydroclimate data acquisition across CONUS. By simplifying access to
diverse data sources through a unified configuration approach, it enables researchers to
focus on scientific questions rather than technical challenges.

Future development plans include: (1) Support for additional data sources based on
community needs; (2) Enhanced tools for large-scale studies requiring data acquisition
over extensive areas; (3) Additional documentation examples demonstrating HySetter's
application in diverse hydrological contexts.
